### Getting started

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```

Finally, open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to view the website.

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
